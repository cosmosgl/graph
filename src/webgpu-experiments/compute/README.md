# Compute Module

*Note: This README was generated by an AI model.*

---

This module contains all compute-related logic for the bouncing disks simulation. It provides WebGPU compute shaders for physics calculations, gravity simulations, and position updates.

## Architecture

The compute module is organized as follows:

- **`compute-manager.ts`** - Main manager class that orchestrates all compute operations
- **`velocity-position-compute.ts`** - Handles position updates based on velocity
- **`physics-compute.ts`** - Implements collision detection and spring physics
- **`gravity-compute.ts`** - Implements gravitational forces between particles
- **`index.ts`** - Module entry point that exports all public classes and types

## Usage

```typescript
import {ComputeManager, ComputeSettings} from './compute'

// Create compute manager
const computeManager = new ComputeManager({
  canvas,
  diskRadius: 0.1
})

// Set initial positions
computeManager.setPointPositions(positionsArray)
await computeManager.initialize()

// Update simulation
const settings: ComputeSettings = {
  physicsEnabled: true,
  physicsStrength: 1.0,
  gravityEnabled: true,
  gravityStrength: 0.2
}
computeManager.update(settings)
```

## Classes

### ComputeManager
The main orchestrator that manages all compute operations and provides a unified interface.

### VelocityPositionCompute  
Handles updating particle positions based on their current velocities.

### PhysicsCompute
Implements collision detection between particles and spring-based physics interactions.

### GravityCompute
Calculates gravitational forces between particles and updates their velocities accordingly.

## Types

### ComputeManagerConfig
Configuration interface for initializing the ComputeManager.

### ComputeSettings
Runtime settings interface for controlling the simulation parameters.
